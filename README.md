# Elbow Joint Design
Designing a **mechanical Elbow Joint** using **SolidWorks** with the goal of improving the geometric design and enhancing the overall aesthetics while maintaining the mechanical requirements.

## Tools & Features Used
- **SolidWorks 2023**  
- Commands:  
  - **Sketch**  
  - **Extrude Boss/Cut**  
  - **Fillet**  
  - **Chamfer**
 
## Elbow Joint Description
The elbow joint is a **U-shaped** part with a base containing cut-out openings to reduce weight and improve aesthetics, along with a circular hole at each vertical end.  
It is used to mechanically connect two parts while allowing for a certain rotation or movement angle.

## Design Improvements

### 1. Customized fillets for circular holes
Applied a larger fillet on the outer edges to make the profile stand out, and a smaller, smoother fillet on the inner edges for a refined finish and reduced sharpness.
